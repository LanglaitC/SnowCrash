We realise that perl is hosting a website on 4646
First using ssh you can create a tunnel to your own computer
By reading the perl program we realise that the queryparameters x is used and can be executed because it is not protected
We are not allowed to use spaces and all letters are capitalized
The solution is to use a wildcard to make the script execute this command :

getflag | wall

So we can write this in /tmp/FLAG
and use the url http://localhost:4646/?x=`/*/FLAG` to output the flag for all users

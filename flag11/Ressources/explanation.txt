If we use top we can see that an lua script is running and was launched by flag11 user
We can guess that this script is the one at the home directory it listens on 5151 port and uses an echo command without protections

We can then inject the getflag command :

echo '; getflag | wall' | nc localhost 5151

we send the flag using the nc command
wall is used so flag11 broacast the answer to all users

Exploit the fact that program uses access function before opening file
We can use exploit.sh script that spams symlink to make the program think we wanna open a file that we own but it is replaced by a symlink to the token file by the time it arrives at open instruction

We use nc -klv 6969 to listen to given port on our machine
